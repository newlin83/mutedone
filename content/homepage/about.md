## Self Introduction

I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2006 with a B.S. in Architectural Engineering. I then attended Texas A&M University and graduated with an M.E. in Civil Engineering (Structural)

I began my career at Walter P Moore as a Graduate Engineer in the Structural Diagnostics Services group in 2007. I left Walter P Moore in 2011, when I then worked for RDH Building Science from 2011 to 2012. 

In 2012 I took some personal time off and worked outside of the industry. In 2014 and 2015 I worked as a structural engineer at two companies in the Washington D.C. area.

In 2015 I moved to Seattle and began working for 4EA Building Science, where I continue to work. I worked remotely from late 2019 until 2023 in Idaho. I then temporarily left 4EA from Feb through Oct of 2023, when I worked for other companies and was going through a difficult personal trouble. In 2024, I hope to get back on track and continue my career with 4EA.

## Details  

I have experience in the following:
- Structural diagnostics
- Air barrier design and detailing
- Structural design
Some project types I work on:
- 5 over 2 (wood frame on podium slab)
- Concrete & steel low-rise
