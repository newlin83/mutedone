-The staff is especially mostly kind helpful, most Elena Patrick. Elena did not sean frightened by my having CAVID, and brought the reading mat & snack Patrick provided ided brief coumpeny 1/20 1/21 Sove of the night staff seems terrified of coming into the room, which isn't a good feel.

* 1/21/2024 took 600mg gabapentin. I will refuse hydroxozire tonight, then try 25 mg tomorrow to see difference. I was skepy in the late afternoon, so the 600mg at morning or noou likely mante me sleep.
