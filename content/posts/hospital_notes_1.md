This is from my time at Harborview Medical Center Psychiatric Inpatient 5WB from 1/15/2024 until 1/25/2024 (final date TBD)

**Stress Reducing Ideas**

1. Remove control from others where I can. someone tells me I must do something, see if there are alternatives. if

2. Be careful about who I give power to (Friends, romantic relationships, pal relationships). There is too much risk when someone has power over me.

3. The "mere urgency effect" means you complete tasks first that seem more time dependent, to the detriment of tae tasks w/o an imusediate deadline.

**Medication Side Effects**

1. Morning Sun 1/21/2024, extreme drowsiness instability upon waking. Went to sleep approx 9PM? Woke around 8.30 AM, Felt unbalanced groggy. I slept very hands last night ssune it was the hydroxative (sp) given on 1/20 around 9PM. I don't know if it was 25 or (50 mg

2. I'm feeling incredibly relaxed w/ no anxiety. All physical symptoms of or anxity, dread, and adrenaline are gore.. even when thinking of the divorce. I feel very much at peace.
