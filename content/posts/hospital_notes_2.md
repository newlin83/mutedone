Continuation of my notes from my stay in the hospital.

**What Works for Me**

- I was happiest and most content (the most recent time at least) from 2017 to 2019. 1 hed my own apt, lots of space and time, and wasn't burdened by other people.

- My mom told me in 2018 she was getting divorced again, but she said it in such a corel and sestish way, it really set me off.

- As a response to my church, and thought For her her failings. natler, I joined a I would make op

- I need to be more selfish & protective of myself. I'm not here to save anyone. There are many people advantage who would like to take of me, so I should avoid them.

- I should surround myself w/ people like me. Advanced degress, self-sufficient, kind to others, not manipulative.

- Set hard boundaries w/ friends, family. Do hot let them got the close they will try to take advantage (some of them will).
